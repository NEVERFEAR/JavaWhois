JavaWhois is a Java library providing an API for querying 'whois' servers for 
named records (usually domain names). In addition to providing the protocol 
level features to communicate with whois servers, the goal of this project is to
provide heuristic response parsers to assemble the result into a consumable 
format by computer applications.
